# python_basics
test projects
this project created when i satrted learning git-hub and python basics with little knowledge about Numpy.
Now i left learning python and almost forgot the language in future i may take up it again not now.
Now I again started learning git/git-hub with the intention of contributing to open source projects in web development using html,css and js.
this code or part of the code can be used by any person/organization, if it is useful for their projects.there is no objection from my side
